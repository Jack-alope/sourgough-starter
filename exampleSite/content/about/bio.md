This theme is targeted at PhD or post doc researchers. It allows for
an easy way to display projects as well as publications. If the user
wants, through GitLab actions, they can have the website update
citation counts from Google Scholar every day. Additionally, through
the use of plux metrics each publication with a DOI will
automatically display citation statistics. This can be turned off in
the config.toml.
